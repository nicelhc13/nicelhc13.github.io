I am Hochan Lee and a PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin since 2018, working under Dr. Keshav
Pingali. I would like to help people to fully leverage the hardwares through their softwares. From this 
motivations, my reseach interests lie in graph analytics and scientific applications, runtime systems and
compilers, and distributed, heterogenous and high-performance computing systems. 

Recently, I have explored a linear algebraic approach for graph anaytic problems
and compared it with a graph approach in terms of performances.
I recently started a research on designing and optimizing distributed systems using a GPUDirect. 
In addition, I also started to participate in Advanced Simulation and Computing Predictive Science
Academic Alliance Program (PSAAP).

Before starting my PhD, I received BScCSE from the Dongguk University, Seoul in 2015, and
was a member of Samsung Software Membership. During this term, I participated in several 
projects tackling the Android framework, including a Android screen sharing
system using WiFiDirect. After graduation, I worked under Dr. Bernhard Egger and received MSCSE from 
the Seoul National University, Seoul in 2017. During my Master, my main research was about
a Xen virtual machine and a compiler optimization for a coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture (CGRA).

In 2020, I have worked at KatanaGraph as an intern. My main mission was to construct real world data
sets for GraphDB. To do this, I have researched on RDF formats and converting systems. 
I also have contributed to hyper graph partitioning technique.
